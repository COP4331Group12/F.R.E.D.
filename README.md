## Vision Statement

Technology is something that is constantly advancing in the world. The simplest of devices are getting smarter, smaller and more powerful. Our group aims to create a product that helps both automakers and automation enthusiast understand, and potentially gain a better grasp of the future of automated vehicles, through the method of scaled down modeling. Group 12 is designing a miniature electric car that can both be controlled manually and autonomously through the use of road sign recognition. With an increased transparency of the potential benefits of autonomy we hope to encourage the amount of automaker activity in the electric vehicle field. As this is a smaller scale model, we compare our device to that of the standard rc car. Our rc car will be able to recognize and respond to visual feedback, unlike conventional ones.

## Sprint 1
Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.
