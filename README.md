## Vision Statement

Our group aims to create a semi-automatically radio-controlled car that can potentially aid both automakers and automation enthusiasts understand and experience the future of automated vehicles through the methods of scaled down modeling. Group 12 is designing a miniature electric car that can both be controlled manually and autonomously through the use of road sign recognition. Our goal is to encourage the amount of automaker activity in the electric vehicle field, as well as promote the possibility of automated cars in the future. As this project is a smaller scale model, we compare our device to that of the standard radio-controlled car. Our RC car will be able to recognize and respond to visual feedback, unlike conventional ones which are driven manually via input commands alone.

## Sprint 1
Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.
