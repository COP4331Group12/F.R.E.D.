| ID | User Story | Effort | Priority | Validation Criteria | Status |
|----|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|--------|

| 001 | As a user, I want to be able to see a live feed of the car's camera so we can verify proper autonomous functionality | 6 | 2 | If the live feed refelects what the car is actually doing during autonomous operation | WORKING |
| 002 | As a user, I want to be able to see a live feed of the car's camera so we can remotely operate the car when it is out of sight | 6 | 2 | If the live feed refelects what the car is actually doing during manual operation | WORKING |
| 003 | As a user, I want to the system to be able to recognize and react to a stop sign so the car can drive autonomously on a designed course.| 8 | 2 | If the system can read and respond to a stop sign before driving past the sign | IN PROGRESS |
| 004 |As a user, I want to be able to control system functions through a user interface on a computer so that the car can be controlled either autonomously or manually from a remote location.| 7 | 1 | If all defined functions can be perfromed using only the user interface | WORKING |
| 005 | As a user, I want the car to be able to drive within 2 white lanes on either side autonomously so the car can accurately drive autonomously on a designed course.| 8 | 1 | If the car can complete a course while always remaning in between the two lanes | WORKING |
| 006 | As a user, I want to be able to control the car remotely from a computer via point-to-point wifi using TCP so that the car can be controlled either autonomously or manually.| 8 | 1 | If the car can perform functions issued through wifi | WORKING |
| 007 | As a user, I want the car to pause before switching between moving forward and backward so that the car's driving is more easily controlled.| 6 | 2 | If the car pauses after pressing forward when the car is already moving backwards and vice versa. | IN PROGRESS |
| 008 | As a user, I want the user interface to have a logging function so that I can see if problems arise during or after operation of the vehicle | 7 | 3 | If after running the user application, a text file is created containing the log of values passed to the vehicle. | WORKING |
